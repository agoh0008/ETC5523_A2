    "text": "Ever wondered why so many of us end up choosing the college majors we do? Is it the promise of high earnings or the allure of job security? According to recent studies, your major might have more to do with economic factors than you think! In fact, the National Center for Education Statistics reported that roughly one-third of undergraduate students who formally declared a major within three years of initial enrollment ended up changing it at least once, with another solid 10 percent switching their major two times or more (Claybourn, 2022).\nIn this article, we will further explore the motivations behind one of life‚Äôs most significant decisions: choosing a college major."

    "section": "Analyzing College Major Choices: Trends and Patterns",
    "text": "Analyzing College Major Choices: Trends and Patterns\nFirst, let‚Äôs take a look at the overall trend of college major choices from 1970-2021. Figure¬†1 reveals that over the decades, Business has consistently stood out as the most pursued major in the United States. What‚Äôs particularly noteworthy is the significant surge in Business graduates from the late 1990s to the early 2010s, signifying a notable trend of heightened interest in Business education during that period. Another compelling development in the early 2010s includes the remarkable growth of graduates in Health Professions and Related Programs, which eventually became the second-most chosen major by the end of 2020-2021. Meanwhile, Social Sciences and History had a consistent hold on the second-most popular spot from 1990 to 2011 before gradually ceding ground to Health Professions.\nThis shift in educational preferences reflects changing career aspirations and societal needs, illustrating the evolving landscape of academic pursuits in the United States. To unravel the factors behind this phenomenon and understand why the majors depicted in Figure¬†1 consistently occupy the ranks of the top ten most popular, we delve deeper into the forces shaping higher education and student decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: Top 10 Most Popular Majors in the U.S. (1970-2021)\n\n\n\n\nPassion vs.¬†Practicality: Major Choice Dilemma\nAccording to research conducted by Ruder & Van Noy (2014), information regarding earnings plays an influential role for students when it comes to selecting both colleges and majors. Figure¬†2 provides a detailed perspective on how median earnings and employment rates correlate with major choices. Each colored point on the scatterplot represents a specific major, with its size reflecting the total number of graduates in that field.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúShowing students median earnings and earnings variation leads to large and significantly different expectations in earnings as well as different choices in college majors.‚Äù - (Ruder & Van Noy, 2014).\n\nEngineering stands out with the highest median earnings at nearly $60,000 and a 94% employment rate. Additionally, business is not only the most popular major, with a significant number of graduates, but it also ranks second in terms of median earnings. Many students seem to prioritize favorable earning potential and a large job market when deciding their majors, with engineering and business programs likely attracting students who have this priority.\nHowever, despite being a popular major, Humanities & Liberal Arts falls on the lower end of both median earnings and employment rates. Similarly, Social Science (which ranks fifth in terms of number of graduates) has the lowest employment rate among all major categories as well as low median earnings. This suggests that a substantial number of students are willing to pursue their passion in these fields, even if it means sacrificing immediate financial boosts and job security for their interests instead. On the other hand, Education has one of the highest employment rates, indicating that graduates in this sector have a higher chance of finding employment. Yet, its median earnings are on the lower end at approximately $32,000; this is consistent with the theory posed by Casselman (2014) that most teachers, presumably, knew they wouldn‚Äôt make much money when choosing their career but do so anyways for the job security it offers.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2: Median Earnings vs Employment Rate by Major Category (2010-2012)\n\n\n\nOverall, the data highlights a balance between passion and practicality when it comes to major selection. Some students prioritize their interests and passions (e.g., Humanities & Liberal Arts), while others favour financial stability and earning potential instead (e.g., Engineering and Business).\n\n\nThe Demographics behind College Majors\n\n\nGender\nAn open question is why women exhibit a greater tendency than men to choose/transition into majors that lead to lower-paid occupations. A study carried out by Kugler, Tinsley, & Ukhaneva (2021) proves women are more inclined than men to switch out of fields that are both male-dominated and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) in response to poor academic performance compared to men. Hence, this leads us to wonder: how exactly is the gender distribution in college majors?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†3: Gender Distribution by College Major (2010-2012)\n\n\n\nLooking at Figure¬†3, it is evident that majors in Humanities & Liberal Arts, Education, Psychology & Social Work, Health, Biology & Life Science, Communications & Journalism, and Arts predominantly attract female graduates, showcasing a significant gender disparity in favor of women. In contrast, Engineering and Computers & Mathematics exhibit a substantial imbalance with a larger number of male graduates compared to their female counterparts, with the proportion of male graduates being 76% and 70% respectively. Business and Social Science majors, on the other hand, seem to have relatively balanced proportions of male and female graduates.\nThese findings highlight the gender disparity in STEM education. With the exception of Health and Biology & Life Science, we can infer that STEM majors appear to primarily attract male students. This is consistent with the previous conclusions by Kugler et al. (2021) and broader trends in STEM fields, where women have historically been underrepresented. Addressing this gender disparity in STEM education and careers remains an important goal for promoting diversity and inclusivity in these fields.\n\n\nEthnicity\nTurning our focus to ethnicity, we also wonder if there are variations within STEM education that relate to different ethnic backgrounds. Table 2 presents a decade-long perspective on the percentage distribution of STEM graduates by race/ethnicity from 2011 to 2021.\nThe percentage of white STEM graduates, while consistently the highest among the demographic groups, has been gradually decreasing over the years. In 2011-2012, it stood at 59.9% but dropped to 48.7% by 2020-2021. Conversely, Hispanic and Asian representation has notably risen, signifying a positive trend toward increased diversity within STEM fields. The Non-resident category also exhibited a relatively steady upward trend over the years, except for the period between 2018 and 2021. This suggests a growing presence of international students participating in STEM programs within the United States.\nIn summary, the data underscores significant changes in the makeup of STEM graduates, showing greater diversity and representation among groups that have historically been less well-represented. While there is room for further improvement in achieving balance, these trends indicate a promising outlook for a more inclusive and diverse future within STEM fields in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      üéì Table 2: STEM Graduates in the United States üéì\n    \n    \n      Percentage Distribution by Race/Ethnicity (2011-2021)\n    \n    \n      Year\n      White\n      Black\n      Hispanic\n      Asian\n      Pacific Islander\n      American Indian/Alaska Native\n      Two or more races\n      Non-resident\n    \n  \n  \n    2011-2012\n59.9%\n8.4%\n8.8%\n9.4%\n0.2%\n0.6%\n1.3%\n11.2%\n    2012-2013\n58.8%\n8.3%\n9.2%\n9.7%\n0.2%\n0.6%\n1.7%\n11.4%\n    2013-2014\n57.7%\n8.2%\n9.6%\n9.5%\n0.2%\n0.6%\n2.2%\n11.9%\n    2014-2015\n55.7%\n8.0%\n10.0%\n9.6%\n0.2%\n0.5%\n2.5%\n13.5%\n    2015-2016\n53.6%\n7.3%\n10.2%\n9.8%\n0.2%\n0.5%\n2.8%\n15.7%\n    2016-2017\n52.1%\n7.1%\n10.6%\n10.0%\n0.2%\n0.5%\n2.9%\n16.7%\n    2017-2018\n51.4%\n7.0%\n11.2%\n10.3%\n0.2%\n0.4%\n3.1%\n16.5%\n    2018-2019\n50.8%\n7.1%\n11.9%\n10.7%\n0.2%\n0.4%\n3.3%\n15.6%\n    2019-2020\n49.7%\n7.2%\n12.3%\n11.0%\n0.2%\n0.4%\n3.4%\n15.8%\n    2020-2021\n48.7%\n7.6%\n12.9%\n11.5%\n0.2%\n0.4%\n3.6%\n15.2%\n  \n  \n    \n      Source: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Fall 2011 through Fall 2020\n    \n  \n  \n    \n       * STEM fields include biological and biomedical sciences, computer and information sciences, engineering and engineering technologies, mathematics and statistics, and physical sciences and science technologies.\n    \n    \n       ** GREEN cells ‚Üí increase in proportion | RED cells ‚Üí drop in proportion."
